\# I am not a software developer. 

My day job is managing data and innovation for an archaeological services business. It faces many of the introverted challenges of a medium sized business, including organising information and achieving consistency between different departments/projects/offices. This makes it a very interesting place for someone like me, who enjoys finding ways of making information more intuitive to gather and more useful. My role is typical of a departmental manager - administration, diplomacy, delegation, promoting and juggling, with only a small sliver of focused personal productivity. More on this another time.
